# Augmented-Reality-3D-Room-Decore

In this project we have developed a Matlab application to add 3D model of chair, lamp, cycle, vase etc in a captured real world image so that it could simulate how would room look like if the object was really present in that environment. For that, we place a physical marker where we have to put the 3D model and acquire the information of placement and orientation of the marker in 3d space, we place our 3D model with same orientation as that of marker. Followed by blending it with captured image.
